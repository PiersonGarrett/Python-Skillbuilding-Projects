# Snapshots on Mac automatically save to the desktop which makes my desktop very messy and I'm sick of it.

I am going to keep it realatively general so it should work on MacOS or Windows (not sure where screenshots on Windows are stored...)

# TODO: Define Problem and Necessary Components and make more todos based on that
